Description: Provide the core functionality to transform longitudinal data to
    complex-time (kime) data using analytic and numerical techniques, visualize the original 
    time-series and reconstructed kime-surfaces, perform model based (e.g., tensor-linear regression)
    and model-free classification and clustering methods in the book Dinov, ID and Velev, MV. (2021)

    The package includes 18 core functions which can be separated into three groups.
    1) draw longitudinal data, such as fMRI time-series, and forecast or transform the time-series data.
    2) simulate real-valued time-series data, e.g., fMRI time-courses, detect the activated areas,
    report the corresponding p-values, and visualize the p-values in the 3D brain space.
    3) Laplace transform and kimesurface reconstructions of the fMRI data.
